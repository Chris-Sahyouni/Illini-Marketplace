Front:
 - let admin delete items
 - report sellers option?
 - add a not-found file
 - maybe change all the fonts
 - sell form needs error message
 - add a notification for the when the user is auto-signed out for session expiration
 - the signature in the bg is rendering too far forward
 - get rid of duplicate id's in every loop-produced element
 - order results by items that have images first (low priority)
 - make forms auto fill characters like - for dates and : for time (low priority)
 - switch all the input classNames to the nice looking kind

 - things can be much simpler by refactoring different funcions used across the site into lib/utilities

 - organize this list

 - buy more image moderations

 - next auth can update session

 - building and class group chats

 - Next auth has a different hook than useSession for server side, use this on more pages to reduce client side load

ALL LOCALHOST URLS NEED TO BE CHANGED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

Back:
 - listings need to be taken down after being unsold for a long period of time
 - accounts need to be removed when the school email addresses are deleted
 - add html to emails to make them look good (low priority)
 - a way of cleaning out images that were uploaded that aren't associated with an item, this could be a script that runs on a github actions cron job (high priority)
 - MEMORY LEAKS IN THE SERVER??? (shouldn't be a problem because the server is this computer)
 - find a better way to update the selling page when a user updates an item than forcing a reload 
 - add a redirect for signing out definitely
 - allow the server IP to the cloudinary admin api
 - add a db seed script
 - add a cron job to recalculate the maximum ranges daily
 - nanoid instead of uuid? (very low priority)
 - delete account option
