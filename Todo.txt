Front:
 - add loading animations
 - let admin delete items
 - let users save items
 - forgot password recovery
 - report sellers option?
 - add a not-found file
 - lock people out for trying to log in too many times
 - maybe change all the fonts
 - restrict inputs for fields that are numbers/dates only etc
 - input fields in the sell form need a character limit
 - some of the input fields in the sell form should be dropdowns instead of text input
 - try using material ui Select component for form inputs
 - all forms need better error messaging, ie fields left empty, incorrect password, image rejected
 - add a your session has expired probably to the root layout
 - if no image is found for the id, it needs to return the placeholder (probably do this by making the image field in each model a boolean of whether or not there is one)
 - the signature in the bg is rendering too far forward
