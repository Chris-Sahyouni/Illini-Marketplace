Front:
 - add loading animations
 - let admin delete items
 - let users save items
 - forgot password recovery
 - report sellers option?
 - add a not-found file
 - lock people out for trying to log in too many times
 - maybe change all the fonts
 - restrict inputs for fields that are numbers/dates only etc
 - input fields in the sell form need a character limit
 - some of the input fields in the sell form should be dropdowns instead of text input
 - try using material ui Select component for form inputs
 - all forms need better error messaging, ie fields left empty, incorrect password, image rejected
 - add a your session has expired probably to the root layout
 - if no image is found for the id, it needs to return the placeholder (probably do this by making the image field in each model a boolean of whether or not there is one)
 - the signature in the bg is rendering too far forward
 - get rid of duplicate id's in every loop-produced element
 - make the logo its own component so it can render on the server
 - make it so useSession is always the first hook called to prevent bugs with not having auth on pages that require it
 - order results by items that have images first (low priority)

 - THE CREATE SUBLEASE ROUTE IS COMPLETELY EMPTY STILL

ALL LOCALHOST URLS NEED TO BE CHANGED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

Back:
 - listings need to be taken down after being unsold for a long period of time
 - accounts need to be removed when the school email addresses are deleted
 - add html to emails to make them look good (low priority)
 - a way of cleaning out images that were uploaded that aren't associated with an item
 - MEMORY LEAKS IN THE SERVER??? (shouldn't be a problem because the server is this computer)
 - there will likely be bugs caused by trying to update values that are optional
 - find a better way to update the selling page when a user updates an item than forcing a reload
