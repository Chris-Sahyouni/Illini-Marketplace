Front:
 - make background render first while website is loading
 - add loading animations
 - let admin delete items
 - let users save items
 - forgot password recovery
 - report sellers option
 - add a not-found file
 - lock people out for trying to log in too many times
 - make a logo and an icon
 - maybe change all the fonts
 - make it so links that require sign in first add a 'sign in first' header to the log in page so users know why they were redirected there

FETCH REQUEST FUNCTIONS MIGHT NEED TO BE ASYNC TO WORK

ALL LOCALHOST URLS NEED TO BE CHANGED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

Back:
 - verify image safety with openai api (could also do this in azure)
 - listings need to be taken down after being unsold for a long period of time
 - accounts need to be removed when the school email addresses are deleted
 - might run into CORS problems
 - add html to emails to make them look good
 - consider using gpt 4 to make an ai powered search
 - make it so the id gets sent over with the item data and is stored in a prop for the card so items can be saved
 - even though the email id magic link url is working, it might be faulty

Database:
 - upgrade to standard tier and maybe add DTUS before deployment (Compute + Storage in Azure)
 - allow the IP address for the server
 - check out prisma full text search for the search funtionality
 - switch address to location for subleases to accomodate high rises
